# 2D_Track
An opensource project on developing a 2d planar tracker for localization of micro movements and drawing. Mostly trying to do drawing

There's many options available in the market including graphics drawing tabs.  However, I would like to develop open design which can be extended beyond drawing

The design and code is in this repository
